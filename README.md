MiscUtils
===================


Starting with JavaScript and nuxeo (2015-07-17), this repository will contain some scripts (mainly JavaScript, maybe some shell scripts) which don't deserve to have a separate repository.

They may be related to nuxoe, but could also be generic utilities.

Basically using GitHub as cloud backup :-)
